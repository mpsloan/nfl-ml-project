### NFL Machine Learning Project

* Study of efficacy of various machine learning models to predict whether the betting favorite covered the spread.

* The target variable was a binary column filled with a 1 if the betting favorite covered or 0 if the favorite did not cover.

* Models implemented in this study consist of: K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.

* Tests were broken up into various iterations of features: Test 1 being the full complement of features, Test 2 being the most crucial features, and Test 3 with every feature except for home and away score.
  * Test 3 is the best representation of a real life scenario as scores are not provided when betting on if a team will cover the spread or not.
